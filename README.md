# Green-Stock-Anaalysis   
Background

Steve is very impressed with the workbook I prepared for him. one click of a button, he can analyze a whole dataset. Now, to do more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Alth``  ough the code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, its take a long time to execute.
In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.
Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
